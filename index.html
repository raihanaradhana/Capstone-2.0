                    <p>
                        I'm currently studying in Hasanuddin University majoring Information System. I learned web development there but only the basics.
                        Now I'm learning it through online courses to get to the advance.

                    <br>
                    <p>Because i like designing websites and I like doing a desc job and web development or software engineer field in general is the perfect
                        example of it
                    </p>

                        <br>
                        <p>I really want to become a film director. My biggest hobby is watching film. I see films as a form of escape, like how we get immersed
                            into someone else's life, or even even into another planet in far galaxy. </p>

                    <p>Even though it's too early to say, but understanding HTML, CSS and Bootstrap does count as coding skills, right?. Anyway there's still a lot
                        to learn in order to get my first job as web developer, but I'll get there eventually.

                    <br>
                    <p>My hobby in watching film translate into my skill in videography. I learned a lot about cinematography and filmmaking in general. I even made 
                        some short films and one of them won in my high school competition ranked at 2nd place, which is not bad.</p>

                    <p>I learned to play electone for a couple of years, but it translate into playing piano instead. I can play a handful of songs, but still can't read
                        sheet music. My dream is to be able to sight read music.
